This is a package with a bash-script as well as other default-styled files for a newly created Django Project. 
This was developed to speed up django-project creation. In many cases you need to do the exact same setup to begin with,
and this is meant to turn thirty-to-sixty minutes of setting up the config yourself into a less-than-a-minute automated setup.

Pro-Tip: If you know nothing of Django, learn to set up a project manually first. This software does not help a new person learn how to use django, 
it simply saves time for the people who already have some knowledge.

## How to Run

git clone git@doggonet.campus.ltu.se:devdoggo/django-advanced-template.git<br />
cd django-advanced-template<br />
chmod u+x setup.sh<br />

./setup.sh or . ./setup.sh<br />
(Option two will put your terminal current directory to the created project's)
